You'll find in this blog my approach to atomic chess. I'll share my thought processes and how I perceive positions when I sit down for a game. And extending beyond the individual game, some tips as to how to study the game. Sometimes you'll get opening lines, endgame analysis, or the odd rambling about my experience playing atomic. Hopefully some of the material gets beginners through that initial phase of surviving past 5 moves more quickly, or help more experienced players sharpen their game with new insights.

Whatever the case, I hope you'll enjoy reading this blog, and enjoy playing atomic even more!
